* `bounds` functions now `force` evaluation of range to avoid bug with S3
  method dispatch inside primitive functions (e.g. `[`)

* Simplified algorithm for `discrete_range` that is robust to
  `stringsAsFactors` global option.  Now, the order of a factor will only be 
  preserved if the full factor is the first object seen, and all subsequent 
  inputs are subsets of the levels of the original factor.
